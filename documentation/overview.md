## What is SpiderFoot?

SpiderFoot automates the process of collecting OSINT by leveraging over **277 modules** to gather information about IP addresses, domains, subdomains, emails, usernames, cryptocurrency addresses, social media profiles, and more. It is suitable for:

- **Threat intelligence and digital footprinting:** Gain visibility into your organization's or target's online presence, uncovering exposed data and potential risks.
- **Attack surface mapping and asset discovery:** Identify all internet-facing assets, including forgotten or shadow IT, to reduce your exposure to attacks.
- **Red teaming and penetration testing:** Support offensive security operations by automating reconnaissance and providing deep context for targets.
- **Brand protection and fraud detection:** Monitor for brand abuse, phishing, and fraudulent activity across the web and dark web.
- **Third-party risk assessment:** Evaluate the security posture of vendors, partners, or acquisitions by mapping their digital footprint.

SpiderFoot is designed for both beginners and advanced users, offering a user-friendly web interface as well as a powerful command-line tool for automation and scripting.
