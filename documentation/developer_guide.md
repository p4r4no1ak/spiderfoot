- Module structure and naming conventions
- Required and optional methods
- Handling events and results
- Debugging and troubleshooting modules

## Version Management

Learn how SpiderFoot manages releases, versioning, and changelogs in the [Version Management Guide](../docs/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md). This is essential for maintaining compatibility and tracking changes.

## Documentation Build

Help keep the documentation up to date! The [Documentation Build Guide](../docs/DOCUMENTATION_BUILD.md) explains how to build, test, and contribute to the docs.
