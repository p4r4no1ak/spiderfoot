Shared Thread Pool Cleanup Fix for SpiderFoot Tests
==================================================

This script provides specific cleanup for SpiderFoot's shared thread pool
workers that are causing thread leaks in tests.

The warning message:
"Potential thread leak detected: ['sharedThreadPool_worker_3', 'sharedThreadPool_worker_2', 'sharedThreadPool_worker_1']"

indicates that these worker threads from SpiderFoot's shared thread pool are not
being properly cleaned up during test teardown.
