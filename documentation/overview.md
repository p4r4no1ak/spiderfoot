# Overview

SpiderFoot is a powerful open source intelligence (OSINT) automation platform designed to help security professionals, penetration testers, and threat analysts map attack surfaces, discover external assets, and gather actionable intelligence from hundreds of public data sources.

## What is SpiderFoot?

SpiderFoot automates the process of collecting OSINT by leveraging over 200 modules to gather information about IP addresses, domains, subdomains, emails, usernames, and more. It is suitable for:

- **Threat intelligence and digital footprinting:** Gain visibility into your organization's or target's online presence, uncovering exposed data and potential risks.
- **Attack surface mapping and asset discovery:** Identify all internet-facing assets, including forgotten or shadow IT, to reduce your exposure to attacks.
- **Red teaming and penetration testing:** Support offensive security operations by automating reconnaissance and providing deep context for targets.
- **Brand protection and fraud detection:** Monitor for brand abuse, phishing, and fraudulent activity across the web and dark web.
- **Third-party risk assessment:** Evaluate the security posture of vendors, partners, or acquisitions by mapping their digital footprint.

SpiderFoot is designed for both beginners and advanced users, offering a user-friendly web interface as well as a powerful command-line tool for automation and scripting.

## Key Features

- **Automated OSINT Collection:** Schedule and run scans to collect intelligence from a wide range of sources with minimal manual effort. SpiderFoot can run unattended, making it ideal for continuous monitoring.
- **200+ Data Gathering Modules:** Integrate with threat feeds, search engines, social media, DNS, WHOIS, breach databases, paste sites, and more. Modules are regularly updated and community contributions are welcome.
- **Web UI and CLI:** Use the intuitive web interface for interactive investigations, visualization, and reporting, or the command-line interface for automation, scripting, and integration with other tools.
- **Enterprise Security Features:** Comprehensive security implementation including CSRF protection, input validation, rate limiting, session management, API security, and structured security logging.
- **Workspaces and Multi-Target Support:** Organize scans, targets, and results into workspaces for collaborative investigations and large-scale assessments. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple projects and share findings with your team.
- **API for Integration:** Integrate SpiderFoot with SIEM, SOAR, and other security tools using the RESTful API with enterprise-grade security features. Automate scans, retrieve results, and trigger actions based on findings.
- **Correlation and Analysis:** Built-in correlation engine to identify relationships, patterns, and risks across collected data. Visualize connections between entities and uncover hidden threats.
- **Custom Module Support:** Easily extend SpiderFoot with your own modules to support new data sources, custom logic, or proprietary integrations. The modular architecture makes development and maintenance straightforward.
- **Notifications and Alerts:** Receive real-time notifications for critical findings, such as data breaches, exposed credentials, or new assets discovered.
- **Export and Reporting:** Export scan results in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HTML) for further analysis or reporting to stakeholders.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Docker images are available for easy deployment.
- **Production-Ready Security:** Battle-tested security middleware with comprehensive protection against common web vulnerabilities and enterprise-grade logging and monitoring.

## Architecture Overview

SpiderFoot consists of the following main components:

- **Core Engine:** Orchestrates scans, manages modules, processes results, and handles scheduling. The engine is highly extensible and supports concurrent scanning.
- **Security Middleware:** Enterprise-grade security layer providing CSRF protection, input validation, rate limiting, session management, API security, and comprehensive logging.
- **Modules:** Each module is responsible for gathering a specific type of data or integrating with a particular source. Modules can be enabled, disabled, or configured individually.
- **Web UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring scans, viewing results, managing workspaces, and visualizing relationships between entities. The UI supports advanced filtering, search, and export features with comprehensive security protection.
- **API:** Enables programmatic access to SpiderFoot's capabilities for integration and automation. The API is fully documented and supports enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and security features.
- **Database:** Stores scan results, configuration, and workspace data. SpiderFoot uses SQLite by default but can be configured for other backends in advanced setups with encryption and secure configuration management.
- **Scheduler:** Allows for automated, recurring scans to ensure continuous monitoring of assets and threats.
- **Security Logging System:** Comprehensive structured logging for security events, audit trails, and compliance monitoring.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Mapping the external attack surface of an organization:** Identify all domains, subdomains, IPs, and other assets exposed to the internet.
- **Discovering forgotten or shadow IT assets:** Uncover assets that may have been overlooked or are no longer actively managed.
- **Investigating threat actors and digital footprints:** Gather intelligence on individuals, organizations, or threat groups using a wide array of data sources.
- **Monitoring for data leaks, breaches, and brand abuse:** Detect compromised credentials, leaked data, and unauthorized use of your brand.
- **Enriching alerts and incidents with OSINT context:** Provide additional context to security alerts and incidents, improving triage and response.
- **Third-party/vendor risk assessment:** Evaluate the security posture of partners, vendors, or acquisition targets by mapping their digital footprint.
- **Red team and penetration test reconnaissance:** Automate the reconnaissance phase of security assessments, saving time and increasing coverage.
- **Continuous monitoring:** Set up scheduled scans to keep track of changes in your attack surface and receive alerts for new findings.
