# SpiderFoot Overview

SpiderFoot is a powerful open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool that integrates with numerous data sources and provides comprehensive intelligence gathering capabilities. It features both traditional single-target scanning and advanced multi-target workspace functionality for enterprise assessments.

## What is SpiderFoot?

SpiderFoot automates the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which may be an:

- **Network subnet (CIDR)** - Network range analysis
- **ASN** - Autonomous System Number investigation
- **E-mail address** - Email and associated account discovery
- **Phone number** - Phone number intelligence
- **Username** - Social media and account enumeration
- **Person's name** - Individual OSINT and background checks
- **Bitcoin address** - Cryptocurrency transaction analysis
- **Company name** - Corporate intelligence gathering

## How SpiderFoot Works

### 1. Target Definition
Specify what you want to investigate:
- **Single Target**: Traditional scan of one entity
- **Multiple Targets**: Workspace-based assessment of related entities
- **Target Validation**: Automatic format validation and type detection

### 2. Module Selection
Choose from 200+ modules organized by category:
- **DNS and Network**: Infrastructure reconnaissance and mapping
- **Search Engines**: OSINT from Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and others
- **Social Media**: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and platform enumeration
- **Threat Intelligence**: VirusTotal, Shodan, ThreatCrowd, and other TI feeds
- **Data Breach**: HaveIBeenPwned, breach databases, and credential dumps
- **Company Intelligence**: Business information and corporate structure
- **Certificate Analysis**: SSL/TLS certificate inspection and validation
- **Geolocation**: IP geolocation and physical location intelligence
- **Darkweb**: Tor and darkweb presence detection
- **Custom Modules**: Organization-specific intelligence gathering

### 3. Automated Discovery
SpiderFoot's modules feed each other in a publisher/subscriber model:
- One module discovers an IP address
- Another module checks that IP for open ports
- A third module analyzes SSL certificates
- The process continues automatically

### 4. Analysis & Reporting
Results are analyzed, correlated, and presented through:
- Interactive web interface
- Relationship graphs
- Risk assessment
- Comprehensive reports

## Use Cases

### Security Assessments

- **Threat actor attribution** and campaign analysis
- **Malware infrastructure** mapping
- **Dark web monitoring** and analysis

### Compliance & Governance
- **Data exposure monitoring** for compliance
- **Brand protection** and monitoring
- **Employee security awareness** training
- **Third-party risk assessment**

### Investigation & Research
- **OSINT investigations** for various purposes
- **Academic research** and analysis
- **Journalism** and fact-checking
- **Law enforcement** support
