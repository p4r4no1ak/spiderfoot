# Advanced Topics

Welcome to the advanced section of the SpiderFoot documentation. This guide covers topics for power users and administrators who want to optimize, secure, and scale their SpiderFoot deployments.

## Docker Deployment

SpiderFoot can be deployed using Docker for ease of setup, isolation, and scalability. See the [Docker Deployment Guide](../docs/docker_deployment.md) for step-by-step instructions on building, configuring, and running SpiderFoot in containers, including tips for persistent storage and networking.

## Performance Optimization

To get the best performance from SpiderFoot, consider:

- Running on a machine with sufficient CPU and RAM, especially for large scans.
- Using SSD storage for faster data access.
- Tuning scan settings (e.g., limiting modules, adjusting timeouts) for your use case.
- Running SpiderFoot in headless mode or via CLI for automation.
- Refer to the [Performance Optimization Guide](../docs/advanced/performance_optimization.md) for detailed tips.

## Security Considerations

SpiderFoot can access sensitive data and should be secured:

- Always use strong passwords for the web UI.
- Restrict access to the web interface using firewalls or reverse proxies.
- Regularly update SpiderFoot and its dependencies.
- Review the [Security Considerations](../docs/security_considerations.md) for best practices.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for common problems and solutions.
