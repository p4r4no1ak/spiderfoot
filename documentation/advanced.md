# Advanced Topics

Welcome to the advanced section of the SpiderFoot documentation. This guide covers topics for power users and administrators who want to optimize, secure, and scale their SpiderFoot deployments.

---

## Docker Deployment

SpiderFoot can be deployed using Docker for ease of setup, isolation, and scalability. See the [Docker Deployment Guide](../docs/docker_deployment.md) for step-by-step instructions on building, configuring, and running SpiderFoot in containers, including tips for persistent storage and networking.

## Performance Optimization

To get the best performance from SpiderFoot, consider:

- Running on a machine with sufficient CPU and RAM, especially for large scans.
- Using SSD storage for faster data access.
- Tuning scan settings (e.g., limiting modules, adjusting timeouts) for your use case.
- Running SpiderFoot in headless mode or via CLI for automation.
- Refer to the [Performance Optimization Guide](../docs/advanced/performance_optimization.md) for detailed tips.

## Security Considerations

SpiderFoot includes enterprise-grade security features that should be properly configured and maintained:

### Built-in Security Features

- **CSRF Protection:** Cross-site request forgery protection with token-based validation
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive input sanitization and validation for all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting:** Advanced rate limiting with memory and Redis backend support
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling with IP validation and timeout controls
- **API Security:** JWT tokens, API keys, and scope-based access control
- **Security Logging:** Structured security event logging with real-time monitoring
- **Security Headers:** Automatic injection of security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Security Configuration

Configure security features in your SpiderFoot configuration:

```python
security_config = {
    'security.csrf.enabled': True,
    'security.csrf.secret_key': 'your-strong-secret-key',
    'security.rate_limiting.enabled': True,
    'security.rate_limiting.api_requests_per_minute': 60,
    'security.input_validation.enabled': True,
    'security.session_security.enabled': True,
    'security.api_security.enabled': True,
    'security.logging.enabled': True,
}
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS:** Always run SpiderFoot over HTTPS in production
- **Strong Secrets:** Use cryptographically secure secret keys for CSRF and JWT
- **Rate Limiting:** Configure appropriate rate limits for your environment
- **Regular Updates:** Keep SpiderFoot and dependencies updated for security patches
- **Access Control:** Restrict network access to SpiderFoot using firewalls
- **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security logs for suspicious activity
- **Backup Security:** Encrypt configuration backups and use secure storage

### Security Validation

SpiderFoot includes a comprehensive security validator:

```bash
cd spiderfoot
python security_validator.py /path/to/spiderfoot
```

This validates all security components and provides a detailed security report.

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure strong CSRF and JWT secret keys
- [ ] Enable and tune rate limiting for your use case
- [ ] Set up security logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure firewall rules to restrict access
- [ ] Enable session security with appropriate timeouts
- [ ] Regularly update SpiderFoot and security configurations
- [ ] Set up automated security validation checks

For comprehensive security documentation, see the [Security Guide](security.md).
